# Sentiment Analyser App

Determine the Sentiments of the sentences whether they fall under Positive, Negative and Neutral categotries along with their scores.

Visit the working app [link](https://sentiment-analyzer-app.herokuapp.com/).

Try out any sentences in English to determine and find its sentiments.

I have used Vader Sentiment Analyzer API which are pre-trained and is a lexicon and rule based to find the sentiments of the sentence.
And is open source too. Visit their [link](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment).

Tech Stack: Python, Flask for RESTAPI's, HTML and CSS.

## Scoring of the Sentence

Compound score of the sentiment can be treated as a useful metric when you want single unidimensional measure of the sentiment.

The positive, neutral and negative scores are ratios for proportions of text that fall in each category (so these should all add up to be 10... or close to it with float operation). 
These are the most useful metrics if you want multidimensional measures of sentiment for a given sentence.
